    <div>Aimed at any <b class="adj">serious</b> programmer or computer science student, the <b class="adj">new</b> second edition of Introduction to Algorithms builds on the tradition of the original with a truly <b class="adj">magisterial</b> guide to the world of algorithms. Clearly presented, mathematically <b class="adj">rigorous</b>, and yet approachable even for the math-averse, this title sets a <b class="adj">high</b> standard for a textbook and reference to the <b class="adj">best</b> algorithms for solving a <b class="adj">wide</b> range of computing problems.

    <div>With sample problems and mathematical proofs demonstrating the correctness of each algorithm, this book is ideal as a textbook for classroom study, but its reach doesn't end there. The authors do a fine job of explaining each algorithm. (Reference sections on basic mathematical notation will help readers bridge the gap, but it will help to have some math background to appreciate the full achievement of this handsome hardcover volume.) Every algorithm is presented in pseudo-code, which can be implemented in any computer language, including C/C++ and Java. This ecumenical approach is one of the book's strengths. When it comes to sorting and common data structures, from basic linked lists to trees (including binary trees, red-black, and B-trees), this title really shines, with clear diagrams that show algorithms in operation. Even if you just glance over the mathematical notation here, you can definitely benefit from this text in other ways. </div>
